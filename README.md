The strangest tour guide in the world is in Italy, they will take you to the monuments, spend 40 minutes to explain the historical background for you, and then say: "Okay, now you can visit by yourself, and gather after 20 minutes." "Since It ’s here to visit. Why are you talking so long and delaying us so much time? ”So someone was not happy, and he went to the next monument without listening to the explanation.

If it were you, would you be like this?

But did you know? According to the survey, people who listened to the 40-minute explanation first and then went to see more than those who did not listen to the explanation and spent an hour exploring on their own. After 60 minutes, return to the tour bus. Those who have heard the explanation first will say that they saw the smile of the statue, the characteristics of the fountain, the mural in a corner, the defect of a stone step, they can even follow the guide To tell the story, imagine the battle that took place in that palace thousands of years ago, and see the blood on the marble.

Visiting places of interest is also like watching birds in the forest.

If someone tells you where there is some kind of bird, follow his instructions, you can see many in a short time. Conversely, if no one directs you, you may only see a forest and hear a lot of birdsong, but you ca n’t find it. Even if you find it, you do n’t know the bird ’s habits, or even what kind of bird it is. The ancients were right—professionals looked at the doorways, and laymen looked at the lively. Next time you go bird watching, travel, and museum, work hard and read the introduction there! Use your heart, your feelings, your understanding of them, get close to them and discover everything!

You must be able to be more moved, and leave a deeper memory.
